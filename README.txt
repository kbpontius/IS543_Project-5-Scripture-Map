Extra Credit:
	Custom Map View:
		- This map view adopts the values placed in the text field after any one of the UITextFields ends editing. While there is very little validation to ensure that the the numbers are actually valid (and not some other form of text), it does work very well. Additionally, some polish was added so that the map view was easy to use (keyboard automatically hides on scroll, the spell correction bar above the keyboard is forced hidden for extra space, and the viewLat and viewLong are automatically populated with the latitude and longitude unless explicitly defined, to avoid incorrect viewLat and viewLong).
		- This map also adopts the current location of the map, if the map detail view is visible (iPhone 6 Plus).
